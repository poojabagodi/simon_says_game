How to Play:
Starting the Game:

Press any key to begin.
The game will show you a sequence of colors by flashing the buttons in a particular order.
Observe the Sequence:

The first round will display just one color.
Each subsequent round will add one more color to the sequence.
Repeat the Sequence:

After the colors flash, it's your turn.
Click on the color buttons in the exact same order as the game showed.
Progressing Through Rounds:

If you correctly reproduce the sequence, you move to the next round, where another color will be added.
Keep repeating the growing sequence.
Losing the Game:

If you click the wrong color or the colors in the wrong order, the game ends.
You’ll be given your score, which is the number of rounds you successfully completed.
Winning the Game:

There’s no definitive end, so try to get the highest score by remembering longer and longer sequences of colors!
